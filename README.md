# async-usb-host

This crate provides an asynchronous USB host implementation for embedded systems, built with the `embassy` framework. It enables communication with USB devices by handling device enumeration, configuration, and data transfer, all in a non-blocking manner. This allows for efficient multitasking and responsiveness in resource-constrained environments.

## Key Features

*   **Asynchronous Operation:** Built with `embassy` for non-blocking USB communication.
*   **Device Enumeration:** Handles the process of detecting and identifying connected USB devices.
*   **Hub Support:** Supports connecting to devices through USB hubs.
*   **Device Management:** Provides mechanisms for managing device addresses and connections.
*   **Data Transfer:** Enables sending and receiving data through control and interrupt pipes.
